# Lesson 1: R base programming {#clase-1-primeros-pasos}

[**Introduction to R and RStudio ecosystems. Working with projects. First uses of functions and packages. Basic data types.**]{style="color:#444442;"}


---

## Requirements

For the course the only requirements will be:

1. [**Internet connection**]{.hl-yellow} (for downloading some data and packages).

2. [**Installing R**]{.hl-yellow}[: it will be our language. The download will be done (free of charge) from <https://cran.r-project.org/>]{.fragment .fade-in}


::: {.fragment .fade-in}
3.  [**Installing RStudio**]{.hl-yellow} from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- We will need a [**grammar**]{.hl-yellow} (`R`)

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- And an environment, for example a [**Word**]{.hl-yellow} (`RStudio`), to write it in.
:::
:::

---

## Installing R

The `R` language will be our [**grammar and spelling**]{.hl-yellow} (our rules).

::: incremental
- [**Step 1**]{.hl-yellow}: go to <https://cran.r-project.org/> and select your operating system.

- [**Step 2**]{.hl-yellow}: for Mac just click on the **.pkg file**, and open it once downloaded. For Windows systems, click on **install R for the first time** and then on **Download R for Windows**. Once downloaded, open it like any other installation file.

- [**Step 3**]{.hl-yellow}: open the installation executable.
:::

. . .

::: callout-warning
Whenever you download something from CRAN (either R itself or a package), [**make sure you have an internet connection**]{.hl-orange}.
:::

---

## First steps

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
To check that it has been installed correctly, after opening `R`, you should see a **white screen** similar to this one.

That "white screen" is called [**console**]{.hl-yellow} and we can make a first use of it as a **calculator**.
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
![](img/consola.jpg){width="200"}
:::
:::

. . .

[**Idea**]{.hl-yellow}: let us define a variable called `a`, and it will be assigned the value `1` (type the code below in the console and hit "enter").

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "1"
a <- 1
```

a <- 1
b <- 2
```

. . .

::: callout-note
## Note that...

In `R` we use `<-` as an arrow: the variable to the left of the arrow is assigned the value to the right (e.g. `a <- 1`).

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
a <- 1
b <- 2
a + b
```

---

## Installing R Studio

`RStudio` will be the [**Word**]{.hl-yellow} that we will use to write (what is known as an [**IDE: integrated development environment**]{.hl-yellow}).

::: incremental
- [**Step 1**]{.hl-yellow}: go to the [official RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (now called Posit) and select the free download.

- [**Step 2**]{.hl-yellow}: select the executable that appears according to your operating system.

- [**Step 3**]{.hl-yellow}: after downloading the executable, open it like any other executable and let the installation finish.
:::

## Pane layout in RStudio

When you open `RStudio` you will probably have three windows:

- [**Console**]{.hl-yellow}: this is the name to call the big window that takes up a good part of your screen. Try writing the same code as before (the sum of the variables) in it. The console will be where we will **execute commands and show results**.

![](img/consola_rstudio.jpg){width="420"}

---

## Pane layout in RStudio

When you open `RStudio` you will probably have three windows:

-   [**Environment**]{.hl-yellow}: the small screen (you can adjust the margins) located at the upper right part. It will show us the **variables we have defined**.

![](img/environment.jpg){width="420"}

---

## Pane layout in RStudio

When you open `RStudio` you will probably have three windows:

-   [**Multi-purpose panel**]{.hl-yellow}: the window at the bottom right will not only be used to search for **function help**, but also to **view graphics**.

## Why R?

![](img/meme_barco.jpg)

---

## Why R?

`R` is the [**main statistical language**]{.hl-yellow}, created by and for statisticians, with 5 fundamental advantages [**over Excel**]{.hl-red}:

::: incremental

- [**Programming language**]{.hl-yellow}: obviousness ‚Üí [**replicable**]{.hl-purple} analysis.

- [**Free of charge**]{.hl-yellow}: the philosophy of the `R` community is code sharing under **copyleft** ‚Üí [**ethical use of public money**]{.hl-purple}

- [**Open source**]{.hl-yellow}: not only is it free but it allows free access to other people's code, even to **own source code** ‚Üí [**flexibility and transparency**]{.hl-purple}

- [**Modular language**]{.hl-yellow}: there are other people's code that we can reuse (almost 20 000 [**packages**]{.hl-yellow}) ‚Üí [**time-saving**]{.hl-purple}

- [**High-level language**]{.hl-yellow}

:::

---

## Why R?

![](img/incel_excel.png)

---

## Why programming?

- [**Automate**]{.hl-yellow} ‚Üí it will allow you to automate recurring tasks.

- [**Replicability**]{.hl-yellow} ‚Üí you will be able to replicate your analysis always in the same way.

- [**Flexibility**]{.hl-yellow} ‚Üí you will be able to adapt the software to your needs.

- [**Transparency**]{.hl-yellow} ‚Üí it could be audited by the community.

![](img/the_general_problem.png)

---

## Main idea: packages

One of the key ideas of `R` is the [**use of packages**]{.hl-yellow}: codes that other people have implemented to **solve a problem**.

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
![](img/paquetes.png)
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
::: {.fragment fragment-index="1"}
- [**Installing**]{.hl-yellow}: download the codes from the web (internet required) ‚Üí [**"buy a book"**]{.hl-purple}, only once (per computer)

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index="2"}
- [**Loading**]{.hl-yellow}: after downloading the package, we indicate which packages we want to use each time we open `RStudio` ‚Üí [**bring the book off the shelf**]{.hl-purple}

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(ggplot2)
```
:::
:::
:::

---

## Main idea: packages

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
![](img/paquetes.png)
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
Once installed, there are two ways to use a package (bring it off the shelf)

::: {.fragment fragment-index="1"}
-   [**The whole package**]{.hl-yellow}: with `library()`, using the package name without quotes, we load into our session the [**whole book**]{.hl-purple}.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(ggplot2)
```
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index="2"}
- [**Some particular functions**]{.hl-yellow} using `package::function` we indicate that we only want a [**concrete page of that book**]{.hl-purple}.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot2::geom_point()
```
:::
:::
:::

---

## You will be wrong

During your learning process, it is going to be very common that things don't go right the first time ‚Üí [**you will make mistakes**]{.hl-yellow}. Not only will it be important to assume this, but it is [**important to read the error messages**]{.hl-yellow} to learn from them.

. . .

-   [**Error messages**]{.hl-red}: preceded by **"Error in... "** and will be those failures that [**prevent execution**]{.hl-red}.

```{r}
#| error: true
"a" + 1 
```

. . .

-   [**Warning messages**]{.hl-orange}: preceded by **"Warning in... "** are the most sensitive (possible) failures since they are inconsistencies that [**do not prevent execution**]{.hl-orange}.

```{r}
#| warning: true
# Code is ok but the result provided a NaN value, **Not A Number**, a value that is not a (real) number
sqrt(-1)
```

---

## Scripts (.R files)

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
![](img/abrir_script.jpg){width="350"}
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
A [**script**]{.hl-yellow} will be the document in which we program, our `.doc` file (here with `.R` extension) where we will write the commands. To **open our first script**, click in the menu on `File < New File < R Script`.
:::
:::

::: callout-warning
## Be careful

It is important **not to overuse the console**: everything you do not write in a script, when you close, [**you will have lost it**]{.hl-orange}.
:::

---

## Executing the first script

Now we have a **fourth window**: the window where we [**write our codes**]{.hl-yellow}. How to run it?

. . .

1. **We write** the code to execute.

. . .

2.  **Save** the .R file by clicking on `Save current document`.

. . .

3.  The code is not executed unless we tell it to do so. We have three options:

- [**Copy and paste**]{.hl-yellow} into console.
- [**Select lines**]{.hl-yellow} and `Ctrl+Enter`.
- [**Enable Source on save**]{.hl-yellow} to the right of save: it not only saves but executes the **whole code**.

---

## üíª Your turn {#tu-turno}

[**Execute your first script**: create a script from scratch, program as indicated below and execute it (in the 3 possible ways)]{style="color:#444442;"}

::: panel-tabset
### [**Exercise 1**]{.hl-yellow}

üìù Define a variable named `a` and whose value is -1.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
a <- -1
```

### [**Exercise 2**]{.hl-yellow}

üìù Add below another line to define a variable `b` with value 5. Then multiply both variables.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
b <- 5
a * b # no saved
mult <- a * b # saved
```

### [**Exercise 3**]{.hl-yellow}

üìù Modify the code below to define two variables c and d, with values 3 and -1. Then split the variables.

```{r}
#| eval: false
c <- # you should assign the value 3
d <- # you should assign the value -1
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
c <- 3
d <- -1
c / d # no saved
div <- c / d # saved
```

### [**Exercise 4**]{.hl-yellow}

üìù Assign a positive value to `x` and calculate its square root; assign another negative `y` and calculate its absolute value with the `abs()` function.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
x <- 5
sqrt(x)

y <- -2
abs(y)
```

### [**Exercise 5**]{.hl-yellow}

üìù Using the variable `x` already defined, complete/modify the code below to store in a new variable `z` the result stored in `x` minus 5.

```{r}
#| eval: false
z <- ? - ? # complete the code
z
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
z <- x - 5
z
```
:::

::: callout-note
## Note that...

Functions as`sqrt()`, `abs()` or `max()` are what we call [**functions**]{.hl-purple}: lines of code that we have "encapsulated" under a name, and given some input arguments, execute the commands (a kind of shortcut).

:::

---

##  Be organized: projects

In the same way that on the computer we usually work [**ordered by folders**]{.hl-yellow}, in `RStudio` we can do the same to work in [**efficient way by creating projects**]{.hl-yellow}.

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
A [**project will be a "folder "**]{.hl-yellow} inside `RStudio`, so our working directory will automatically be the project folder itself (you can switch from one project to another with the top right menu).

We can create one in a new folder or in an existing folder.
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](img/rstudio_proyectos.png){width="370"}
:::
:::

---

## From the VALUE to the DATABASE

What [**data type**]{.hl-yellow} can we have in each cell of a **database**?

![](img/celdas.jpg){fig-align="middle"}

::: incremental
- [**Cell (single value)**]{.hl-yellow}: single data of a specific type.
- [**Variable**]{.hl-yellow}: **concatenation** of values of the same type ([**vectors**]{.hl-purple}).
- [**Matrix**]{.hl-yellow}: concatenation of variables of **same type and length**.
- [**Data table**]{.hl-yellow}: concatenation of variables of [**different type but equal length**]{.hl-purple}.
- [**List**]{.hl-yellow}: concatenation of variables of [**different type and different length**]{.hl-purple}
:::

---

## Type of (single) data

Are there [**variables beyond numbers**]{.hl-yellow}?


. . .

Let us think, for example, of a person's stored data:

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- The age or weight will be a [**numeric variable**]{.hl-yellow}.

```{r}
age <- 33
```
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- Its name will be a string of [**text (string or char)**]{.hl-yellow}.

```{r}
name <- "javi"
```
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- To the question "Are you single?", the answer will be what we call as a [**logical variable**]{.hl-yellow} (`TRUE` if you are single or `FALSE` otherwise).

```{r}
single <- TRUE
```
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
-   Your date of birth will be just that, a [**date**]{.hl-yellow}.

:::

---

## Numeric variables

The simplest data (we have already used it) will be the [**numeric variables**]{.hl-yellow}

```{r}
#| eval: false
a <- 5
b <- 2
a + b
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
a <- 5
b <- 2
a + b
```

. . .

To know the type of a variable we have the function `class()`.

```{r}
class(a)
```

. . .

With numeric variables we can perform the [**arithmetic operations**]{.hl-yellow} of a calculator: addition (`+`), square root (`sqrt()`), square (`^2`), etc.

```{r}
a^2
abs(a)
```

---

## String variables

Let us imagine that, in addition to the age of a person, we want to store his/her name: now the variable will be of type `character`.

```{r}
name <- "Javier"
class(name)
```

. . .

[**Strings variables**]{.hl-yellow} are a type with which we obviously [**cannot perform arithmetic operations**]{.hl-red} (other operations such as pasting or locating patterns can be performed).

```{r}
#| error: true
name + 1
```

. . .

::: callout-warning
## Note that...

String variables are [**ALWAYS in quotes**]{.hl-orange}: `TRUE` (logical, binary value) is not the same as `"TRUE"` (char or string).
:::

---

## First function: paste

In `R` we denote as [**function**]{.hl-yellow} a piece of [**encapsulated code**]{.hl-yellow} under a name, and which depends on some input [**arguments**]{.hl-yellow}. Our first function will be `paste()`: given two strings, it allows us to paste them together.

```{r}
paste("Javier", "√Ålvarez")
```

. . .

Note that [**default**]{.hl-yellow} pastes strings with a space, but we can add an [**optional argument**]{.hl-yellow} to tell it the separator (in `sep = ...`).

```{r}
paste("Javier", "√Ålvarez", sep = "*")
```

---

## First function: paste

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/paste_help.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
How to know [**what arguments a function needs**]{.hl-yellow}? By typing `? paste` in the console, you will get a [**help**]{.hl-yellow} in the multi-purpose panel.

In this help panel, you will see in its header what arguments the function already has [**default**]{.hl-yellow} assigned to it.
:::
:::

. . .

There is a similar function named as `paste0()` that pastes by default with `sep = ""` (without anything else).

```{r}
paste0("Javier", "√Ålvarez")
```

---

## First package: glue

A more intuitive way to work with string variables is to use the `{glue}` package: the first thing to do is to "buy the book" (if we have never done it before). After that [**load the package**]{.hl-yellow}

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("glue")
library(glue)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(glue)
```

. . .

This package allows us to use [**variables inside strings**]{.hl-yellow}. For example, "I am ... years old", where the age is stored in a variable.

```{r}
age <- 33
glue("I am {age} years old")
```

. . .

Inside brackets we can also execute operations

```{r}
units <- "days"
glue("I am {age * 365} {units} old")
```

---

## Logical conditions

Another fundamental type will be the [**logical or binary or boolean variables**]{.hl-yellow} (**just two values**):

- `TRUE`: [**true**]{.hl-yellow} stored internally as a 1.
- `FALSE`: [**false**]{.hl-yellow} stored internally as a 0.

```{r}
single <- TRUE # Are you single? --> YES
class(single)
```

. . .

It can take a third value, `NA` or [**missing data**]{.hl-yellow}, the acronym for *not available*.

. . .

::: callout-important
## Important

Logical variables [**NOT string variables**]{.hl-red}: `"TRUE"` is a string, `TRUE` is a logical value.

```{r}
#| error: true
TRUE + 1
"TRUE" + 1
```
:::

---

## Logical conditions

Logical values are usually the result of [**evaluate logical conditions**]{.hl-yellow}. For example, let us imagine we want to check if my name is Javi.

```{r}
name <- "Mar√≠a"
```

. . .

The [**logical operator**]{.hl-yellow} `==` allow us to ask if left equals right.

```{r}
name == "Javi"
```

. . .

With its opposite `!=` we ask if it is different.

```{r}
name != "Javi"
```

. . .

::: callout-note
## Note that...

It is not the same `<-` ([**assignment**]{.hl-yellow}) as `==` (we are [**asking**]{.hl-yellow}, it is a logical comparison).

:::

---

## Logical conditions

In addition to "equal to" versus "different" comparisons, also order comparisons such as `<, <=, > or >=`.

**Is the person less than 32 years old?**

```{r}
age <- 38
age < 32
```

**Age is greater than or equal to 38 years old?**

```{r}
age >= 38
```


---

## Date variables

A very special data type: the [**date type data**]{.hl-yellow}.

```{r}
date_char <- "2021-04-21"
```

. . .

It looks like a simple string but [**represents an instant in time**]{.hl-yellow}. What should happen if [**we add a 1 to a date**]{.hl-purple}?

```{r}
#| error: true
date_char + 1
```

. . .

Dates [**cannot be string variables**]{.hl-red}: we must convert string variables to date with `as_date()` from the `{lubridate}` package.


```{r}
library(lubridate)
date <- as_date("2023-03-28")
date + 1
class(date)
```

---

## Date variables

In this package we have very useful functions for [**handling dates**]{.hl-yellow}:

-   `today()` allowes to directly obtain the [**current date**]{.hl-purple}.

```{r}
today()
```

. . .

-  `now()` allows to obtain [**current datetime**]{.hl-purple}

```{r}
now()

## üíª Your turn {#tu-turno-1}

[**Try to solve the following exercises without looking at the solutions**]{style="color:#444442;"}

::: panel-tabset
### [**Exercise 1**]{.hl-yellow}

üìù Define a variable that stores your age (named as `age`) and another with your name (named as `name`).

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
age <- 33
name <- "Javi"
```

### [**Exercise 2**]{.hl-yellow}

üìù Define another variable named as `siblings` that answers the question "do you have siblings?" and another one with the date of your birth (named as `birth_date`).

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
siblings <- TRUE

library(lubridate)
birth_date <- as_date("1989-09-10")
```

### [**Exercise 3**]{.hl-yellow}

üìù Define another variable with your last names (named as `surnames`) and use `glue()` to have a single variable `full_name` (separating first and last name by a comma).

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
surnames <- "√Ålvarez Li√©bana"
glue("{name}, {surnames}")
```

### [**Exercise 4**]{.hl-yellow}

üìù Compute the days that have passed from the date of your birth until today (with the date of birth defined in exercise 2).

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
today() - birth_date
```
